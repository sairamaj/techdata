## Service Simulator
### What
    
A Generic purpose http __soap__ or __rest__ simulator     

### Why
    When developing a application which is communicating to external 3rd party we need to test various scenarios to see how our service behaves. With service simulator one can simulate different scenarios without having actual 3rd party service.
